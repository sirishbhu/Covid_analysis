### Installation<a name="Install"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation<a name="Motivation"></a>

In this project I used the crowd-sourced Covid-19 India database to find some interesting patterns that tell about the performance of different states of India.

The daily data that we see on the television and the internet is served in a predefined form.We donâ€™t have a choice to see the reports on a particular aspect or a combination of different aspects that we might be interested in.
I faced a similar situation and so, I crunched out some interesting data that might intrigue you.

### File Descriptions<a name="File"></a>

There is a single notebook file containing the entire code that explores three relationships and try to give a useful insight to the user.In addition to it,there are three dataset files.

### Results<a name="Results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@sirishbhudolia88/a-look-at-how-indian-states-are-faring-against-covid-19-2717ebbf67f9).

The credit for the dataset goes to [this](www.api.covid19india.org). However,they have recently updated their website and the dataset is no longer available in .csv format .The dataset is crowdsourced so the license is not required.
